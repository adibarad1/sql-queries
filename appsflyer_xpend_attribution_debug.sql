-- SCRIPT NAME: appsflyer_xpend_attribution_debug
-- VERSION: v1.0
-- AUTHOR: Adi B.
-- CREATED: 2024-11-03
--
-- PURPOSE:
--   Cross-validate AppsFlyer install and purchase events against xPend cost data.
--   Used to investigate discrepancies in campaign attribution or revenue mismatch.
--
-- DESCRIPTION:
--   - Loads xPend cost data and matches it with install & purchase events from CF_APPSFLYER_PUSH
--   - Joins based on date, app_id, geo, and flexible matching of campaign structure fields
--   - Aggregates purchase revenue per member, marking first-time deposits (FTD)
--   - Final result includes combined cost, install, purchase, and payment information
--   - Filters by a specific `unique_str` identifier for debugging purposes
--
-- USAGE:
--   Useful for validating whether a given `unique_str` combination is correctly attributed
--   in AppsFlyer and cost systems. Helps identify issues with campaign, adset, or keyword mapping.
--
-- NOTES:
--   - JOINs use null-tolerant logic to allow partial match when fields are missing
--   - Aggregated by all fields due to Snowflakeâ€™s `GROUP BY` requirement on SELECTed columns
--   - Payments are enriched with platform and FTD status for cohort-level insights
--   - `unique_str` is expected to uniquely identify a campaign/ad group context
--   - To run this query for other cases, modify the `WHERE unique_str = '...'` filter
